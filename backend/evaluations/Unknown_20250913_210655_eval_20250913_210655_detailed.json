Initialize Queue with Zero-Indegree NodesThese are the courses you can take immediately (no prerequisites).    q = deque([i for i in range(numCourses) if indegree[i] == 0])    taken = 0Initially:q = [0] (only course 0 can be taken).3. Process the QueuePop from queue → decrement indegree of neighbors → if any neighbor’s indegree becomes 0, push to queue.    while q:        course = q.popleft()        taken += 1                for neighbor in adj[course]:            indegree[neighbor] -= 1            if indegree[neighbor] == 0:                q.append(neighbor)This ensures a course is only available once all its prerequisites are met.4. Check if All Courses Can Be Finished    return taken == numCoursesIf some nodes never got indegree = 0, that means there was a cycle.✅ Time Complexity:Building adjacency list: O(E).Initializing indegree array: O(E).Queue operations: each course enqueued/dequeued once → O(V).Each edge processed once in the inner loop → O(E).Total = O(V + E).✅ Space Complexity:Adjacency list: O(V + E).Indegree array: O(V).Queue: O(V).Total = O(V + E).🔹 DFS Approach — Where Can It Fail?DFS works with 3 states per node:0 = unvisited1 = visiting (in recursion stack)2 = visited (finished)If you re-visit a node in visiting state → cycle detected.But here are pitfalls:Multiple CyclesDFS correctly detects a cycle as soon as it hits one.But if you don’t stop properly, you might double-report cycles or recurse unnecessarily deep.Fix → return immediately on first cycle detection.Duplicate EdgesExample: [[1,0], [1,0]].Without handling duplicates, indegree array increments twice.BFS still works (because it decrements correctly), but DFS may recurse twice unless you mark states correctly.Fix → duplicates don’t break correctness, just efficiency.Disconnected ComponentsGraph may not be fully connected (e.g., [ [1,0], [3,2] ]).DFS must check every node (not just start from 0).Otherwise, you miss cycles in other components.Deep Recursion LimitIf numCourses is very large (like 10⁵), DFS can hit Python recursion depth.BFS (Kahn’s Algorithm) avoids this pitfall.🔹 Key TakeawaysIndegree (Kahn’s Algorithm) is iterative, safe for large inputs, and handles multiple prerequisites naturally.DFS is elegant but must carefully manage state to avoid false cycle detection.Edge Cases:Multiple prerequisites → handled by indegree decrement logic.Multiple cycles → DFS needs proper cycle detection logic.Duplicate edges → minor inefficiency, not incorrect.Disconnected graph → must loop over all nodes.",
